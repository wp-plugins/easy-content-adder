A WordPress plugin to easily add content to all of your Pages, Posts, and Custom Post Types.

== Description ==
Easy Content Adder allows you to add custom content via a native WordPress editor and display the content at the top or bottom of all posts, pages, or both. The plugin also supports all custom post types and provides the ability to hide the content from all pages without the need to remove your content or disable the plugin. All text, links, and media attachments can be added to the custom content. If you can add it to a WordPress Page or Post, it can be added via Easy Content Adder.
